# Code Snippet Generator

A web application designed to leverage OpenAI's powerful models to generate code snippets based on user inputs. This project integrates a FastAPI backend with a simple, interactive frontend, allowing users to input their code-related queries and receive corresponding code snippets in real-time.

## Features

- **Interactive Chat Interface:** Users can interact through a simple web interface, entering their programming queries and receiving code snippets as responses.
- **OpenAI Integration:** Utilizes OpenAI's models to generate accurate and relevant code snippets for a wide range of programming queries.
- **FastAPI Backend:** A robust and fast backend built with FastAPI, providing efficient handling of requests and responses.
- **CORS Support:** Configured to handle Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS), allowing frontend requests from various origins for development flexibility.
- **Environmental Variables:** Utilizes environment variables for secure storage of OpenAI API keys and organization keys.

## Setup and Installation

1. **Clone the Repository**
git clone <repository-url>
cd <repository-folder>

2. **Environment Variables**
Create a `.env` file in the root directory of the project and add your OpenAI credentials:
openai_key=YOUR_OPENAI_API_KEY
org_key=YOUR_ORGANIZATION_KEY


3. **Install Dependencies**
Ensure you have Python 3.8+ installed. Set up a virtual environment and install the required packages:

python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate # On Windows use .\venv\Scripts\activate
pip install -r requirements.txt


4. **Run the FastAPI Server**
Start the FastAPI application:
uvicorn main:app --reload

The API will be available at `http://localhost:8000`.

5. **Open the Frontend**
Open the `index.html` file in a browser to access the web interface.

## How to Use

1. Type your programming query in the message input box on the web interface.
2. Press Enter or click the "Send" button.
3. The code snippet generated by OpenAI will be displayed in the chat interface.
